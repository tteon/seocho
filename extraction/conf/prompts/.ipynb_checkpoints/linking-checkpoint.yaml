linking: |
  You are an expert entity linking system. Your goal is to identify duplicate entities and link them to a canonical ID.
  
  You will be provided with a list of extracted entities from a document in the category: {{ category }}.
  
  Task:
  1. Analyze the entities for semantic similarity and potential duplicates (e.g., "SpaceX" and "Space Exploration Technologies Corp").
  2. For each entity, assign a "linked_id". If it maps to a well-known concept, use a standardized URN (e.g., "urn:entity:spacex"). If it is a local entity found multiple times, normalize the ID.
  3. Return the JSON with the same structure but with an added "linked_id" property for each node.
  
  Input Entities:
  {{ entities }}
  
  Output Format (JSON):
  {
    "nodes": [
      { "id": "...", "label": "...", "properties": { ..., "linked_id": "urn:..." } }
    ],
    "relationships": [...]
  }
